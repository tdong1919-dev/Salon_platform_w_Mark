Use web search for current, real signals (recent trends, popular services, pricing moves, what nearby or comparable businesses are promoting). Be specific and recent — cite what you found in plain language, no fabricated stats.

Format exactly with these markdown sections, nothing else:
# <punchy 4-6 word headline>
**This month at a glance** — 2 sentences.
## Trending now
- 3-4 bullets: specific services, ingredients, or formats gaining traction in their niche.
## What competitors are doing
- 3-4 bullets: pricing, promotions, packaging, or positioning moves worth noting.
## 3 moves for you
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
Each move concrete and doable this month. Keep the whole thing under ~350 words.`;
