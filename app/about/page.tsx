              Crystal&apos;s work spans salon ownership, education, marketing, product partnerships, and business
              implementation. That range is what shapes JIDOKA Cosmetics OS: practical systems built for real
              teams, not theory.

              Since 2017, Crystal has built and operated full-service salons, served as an international educator
              for Socolashes California, spoken at beauty conferences, sold online courses, and received mentorship
              through industry experts from New York and Los Angeles.
            </p>
            <p>
              She has been featured in Eyelash Magazine and has worked with major beauty brands and industry
              platforms including Illumino, PMD, Dermalogica, Beautifulwandz, and LashCon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crystal also ran a marketing agency for five years, servicing salons, spas, medspas, and plastic
              surgeons. When it comes to the struggles cosmetic businesses deal with, that almost-decade of
              experience means she understands the path from solopreneur to enterprise level.
